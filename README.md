# Unnamed Tower Defense Game
This is a tower defense game where you fight evil bugs that are trying to destroy a base you just placed down.

## Play
If you would like to play the game check out the [releases](https://github.com/MartinAllsbrook/Tower-Defense/releases)! I currently only have a Windows release but @ me in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/763qEmm8hV) if you want to play on a mac and I will make a macOS build aswell.  

You can also let me know what you think in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/763qEmm8hV), I would love to hear your feedback. Thanks :)
