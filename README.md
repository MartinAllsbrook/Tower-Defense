## Plugins
### [Quantum Console](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/quantum-console-211046)
This project uses the QFSW's Quantum Console Package. It can be downloaded [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/quantum-console-211046). It is not necessary but the prefab will need to be deleted from the scene if you do not have it.
